      "The creation of the **RCacheSuite** package was largely motivated by my research (joint with my advisor Duncan Temple Lang and Deborah Nolan) in non-linear documents. The concept, briefly, is documents which can represent the forking, non-linear structure of how data analyses are performed in practice, including the confirmatory asides, initial or alternative methods which didn't work, etc.\n",

      "In the context of caching results, the main consequence of these multiple threads through the document is that some pieces of code within the document will need to be evaluated using different values of the (input) variables used by the code during the processing of different threads. Unlike with linear documents, this can occur even if all the code in the document is entirely non-random and the code as well as any files/libraries/data used by it remain unchanged.\n",
      "\n",
      "This multiplicity of evaluation states directly contravenes the conceptual model in use by existing dynamic document and general expression-based caching mechanisms in R. The model in place there, which is reasonable for linear documents, assumes that the output from evaluating a piece of (non-random) code is constant (and thus cacheable) so long as any *code* in the document which affects the variables used by the code block remains unchanged.\n",
      "\n",
      "The assumption of a linear document (or a linear series of expressions) with code-only based dependencies made by existing caching mechanisms lead them to implement a system where there is a one-to-one correspondence between expressions/code blocks and caches. When a cache is determined to be \"dirty\" (ie the code needs to be re-evaluated) due to a change in the code of its dependencies, it is assumed those changes represent a premanent alteration to the documentt and the cache corresponding to the code is overwritten using new results generated from the re-evaluation of the code. (if the code in the block itself changes, the old cache won't even be recognized, as lookup is based on a hash of the code)\n",
